# Illustrate Software Principle using concept-oriented philosophy with constant micro knowledge

- Maintainable
- Reuseable
- Extendable
- Testable
- Deployable
  
Achieve by following SOLID (Achieve by using Design Pattern)

Example:

1, Design a Library so that students can understand feature Dependency Inversion -> Implement it -> Create Application to use the Lib
2, Design a Library so that students can understand Strategy, Command Pattern -> Implement it -> Create Application to use the Lib
3, Design some Libraries so that students can understand how JPA work with Hibernate or Eclipse at runtime (CompileTime without error, issue raise when an application just use JPA interface on Runtime)
4, Design a SPI so that studens can understand how Tomcat (a web server) can work with different .jar 
5, Design an common lib so that student can understand how  data column change do not effect application level(hint: JPA and Hibernate)
