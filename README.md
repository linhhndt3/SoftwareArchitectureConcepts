# Illustrate Software Principle using concept-oriented philosophy with constant micro knowledge, perior based knowledge

- Maintainable
- Reuseable
- Extendable
- Testable
- Deployable
  
Achieve by following SOLID (Achieve by using Design Pattern)

Example:

- Design a Library so that students can understand feature Dependency Inversion -> Implement it -> Create Application to use the Lib
- Design a Library so that students can understand Strategy, Command Pattern... -> Implement it -> Create Application to use the Lib
- Design some Libraries so that students can understand how JPA work with Hibernate or Eclipse at runtime (without error at CompileTime, issue raise when an application just use JPA interface at Runtime)
- Design a SPI so that studens can understand how Tomcat (a web server) can work with different .jar 
- Design an common lib so that student can understand how  data column change do not effect application level(hint: JPA and Hibernate)
- Illustrate the motivation behind thread (performance and responsiveness) using example
- Object Relationship (has-a and is-a)
- Non-Blocking & Blocking (reference at Michael's course)

** Bonus **
- Learning how to learn
- Key Board Shortcut for Intel, for Chrome
